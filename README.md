# ECHO - Enhanced Collaboration for Human-Robot Operations

## VCU College of Engineering

## Project Description

This project will refine the sensing and control systems of industrial robots, enabling real-time adjustments to movement, position, and speed based on the human userâ€™s proximity, orientation, and actions. This system will rely on real-time location data, velocity, and trajectory tracking to enable robots to dynamically respond to human presence, more effectively collaborate, and enhance both safety and efficiency. The solution will integrate a turn-based interaction protocol, allowing robots and humans to collaborate on tasks like constructing a tower of alternating red and blue blocks. Vision systems will classify and locate blocks in real-time, while task-planning algorithms optimize the sequence of actions, minimizing unnecessary movements. To ensure smooth collaboration, visual and auditory cues, as well as proximity sensors, will coordinate turns and maintain safe working zones. Additionally, the system will feature an emergency stop mechanism and a user-friendly interface, ensuring clear communication and real-time feedback between the robot and human operator.
