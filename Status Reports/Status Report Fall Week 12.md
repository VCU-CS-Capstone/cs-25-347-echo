## 1) Accomplishments this week

- Held advisor meeting (11/15/24) to review poster and project direction
- Received detailed feedback on poster layout improvements:
  - Identified areas needing visual refinement (citation size, blue box compression)
  - Discussed spacing adjustments for timeline/dataflow and challenges sections
  - Determined need to follow grid lines and compress phase shapes
- Refined use case scenario:
  - Developed new focus on human-robot interaction scenarios
  - Established approach to start simple and increase complexity gradually
  - Identified key technical considerations around robot self-localization

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week

- Implement poster layout improvements:
  - Relocate use case below citations
  - Replace text descriptions with visual elements
  - Adjust element sizes and spacing according to feedback
  - Update images to avoid compression issues
- Develop detailed implementation plan for new use case scenario
- Follow up with Jo√£o regarding project updates

## 3) Issues, problems or concerns

- Need to address potential challenges with robot self-localization
- Require backup plan for boolean logic failures in implementation
- Working to simplify dataflow diagram while maintaining clarity
