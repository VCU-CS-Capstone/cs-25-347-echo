# Status Reports Folder

Weekly status reports go into this folder

This README.md serves as the front page of this folder - update the table with very succinct weekly reports.

Project Plan.md is a document that should be updated accordingly as the project develops through the year.

Status Report Fall Week XX.md is a template for to copy-paste into new Status reports you generate every week.

## Fall Semester

| Document | Tasks | Accomplishments | Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 Status Report | Initial team meeting | Assigned designated roles and worked on team contract | No problems to report! |
| Week 2 Status Report | Meet with project sponsor and faculty advisor| Met with project sponsor/faculty advisor and got background information on the project and scope | No problems to report! |
| Week 3 Status Report | Research different sensor types that we can add on/replace to current sensor type, Explored more of the documentation left by the previous team and bring our findings to the sponsors | Narrowed down to a few sensors like the kinect V2, mmWave sensor, retroreflective bead. Also saw the robot that we will be interacting with and the technologies used to interact with that robot | |
| Week 4 Status Report | Spend some time researching different kinect v2 sensor robotics application, mmWave sensors and retroreflective bead technology | Team has decided to test out a couple of different sensors as possible solutions | |
| Week 5 Status Report | Order/Test out the different sensor when they come in | Orders have been placed by sponsor | Waiting on product to test out |
| Week 6 Status Report | Test and gain understanding of how to practically use the technologies/sensors that will be used| Downloaded Isaac Sim and got demo code from Miles. | Product has not arrived |
| Week 7 Status Report | Test sensors that have arrived | Downloaded different SDK/dependencies for mmWave sensor to test. | Tried to visualize mmWave data but ran into an issue where the visualizer can't connect to the COM ports of the mmWave sensor. And we are still waiting on the other sensors that was ordered to arrive. |
| Week 8 Status Report | Continuation of sensor testing. | LiDAR sensor is functional, and testing its limitations. | A little trouble setting up mmWave, Sam will be taking over setup for this sensor. |
| Week 9 Status Report | Backtrack through Dylan's documentation. | Drivers for mmWave have been installed. | Documentation is a little sparse, will have to fill in gaps along the way. |
| Week 10 Status Report | Discuss possible sensor orientations/configurations, as well as use cases to expand upon. | Clearer understanding of how to approach our goal, and the steps we must take in order to achieve it. | Misdirection of how to approach making sensor configuration prior to meeting, however meeting with mentors cleared everything up. |
| Week 11 Status Report | | | |
| Week 12 Status Report | Review and improve poster layout, refine use case scenarios | Received detailed feedback on poster improvements, developed new human-robot interaction scenario focus | Need to address robot self-localization challenges and boolean logic backup plans |
| Week 13 Status Report | | | |
| Week 14 Status Report | | | |
| Week 15 Status Report | | | |
| Week 16 Status Report | | | |
